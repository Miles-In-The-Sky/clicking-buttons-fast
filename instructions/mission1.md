## *Mission 1 - Replicating the first webpage ever built* 

### The Mission
**Why this mission matters (60 words)**

In this mission you will learn how the basics of the web work and you'll do that by getting your hands dirty.

**What will you learn**

The basics of HTML structure, how to work with REPL.IT and get your hands on a few basic git commands.

**Where are we going next (we are learning this so that we can achieve that)**

After you get the HTML done we will move to CSS where you'll learn how to style a webpage.

**Steps to complete mission**

In this mission you will find an `index.html` in the root folder. This `index.html` will link to other pages that are inside the folder `WWW` (exactly the same as the original one). During this mission you will have to create your own `.html` files as well as subfolders.
